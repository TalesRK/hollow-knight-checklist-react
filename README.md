Buy Hollow Knight, it's pretty great!

## What is this?

This is intended to allow visitors to track their progress towards finishing the entire game. It remembers your progress, is easy to use on mobile devices, and contains many links to the game's wiki for easy reference.

## Wishlist

There are several features which would be nice to have, among them:

-   The ability to add the page to your device's home screen, so it can be used as an offline app for phones. This would involve setting up a manifest.
-   Add in everything that doesn't actually contribute to the total percent. For example, right now not all bosses are listed, only the required ones.
-   Grub list
-   List items having links to appropriate maps (probably not going to happen as the wiki tends to keep things nicely updated for us, but it would be handy)
